<h1 class="mt-2 mb-4">Data Bridge Service</h1>
{% load static %}
<p>The Data Bridge is a service that is aimed to solve the problem
    of tracking between related datasets within CCI and C3S. Many of the
    ECV datasets that were initially produced under CCI, have been
    either brokered, or go on to transition into an operational phase
    within the Copernicus Climate Change Service. However, the exact
    relationship between the data can vary between projects and can be
    complex.</p>
<p>A complication is that the way that a 'dataset' has been defined is 
     generally different between CCI and C3S. In the case of C3S, the
     DOIâ€™d landing page in the C3S Climate Data Store, contains multiple
     options that can be selected, some of which often correspond to the
     CCI datasets; however, it is also the case that a CCI dataset may
     also contain homogeneous subsets which are used separately. 
     See <a href="{% url 'relation-type-list' %}">Relation Types</a> for
     the list of terms currently used to define relationships.
<p>From the <a href="{% url 'dataset-list'  %}">Datasets</a> page you can
     select a dataset and then view information about related datasets.</p>
<p>The <a href="{% url 'sankey'  %}">Sankey Diagram</a> page allows you to
     view and download various diagrams depicting the relationships between
     selected datasets.</p>
<p>The <a href="{% url 'docs-api'  %}">API Docs</a> have been generated from
     an <a href="{% static 'cci_data_bridge/openAPI.yaml' %}">Open API yaml
     </a> file using Swagger UI. This docs page is an interactive page that
     allows you to query the service via the API.</p>
